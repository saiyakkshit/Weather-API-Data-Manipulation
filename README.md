 # Weather API Data Manipulation

This project aims to demonstrate your skills in working with APIs, data manipulation, and two different platforms: Airtable and the Make platform. The task involves building a dynamic table that retrieves real-time temperature data for various cities using a weather API.

## Instructions

Follow the detailed instructions below to complete the assignment:

### Airtable Setup

1. Create a table in Airtable with the following three column headers:
   - 'City': To store the names of various cities.
   - 'Check Temp': To incorporate a button that triggers a script within Airtable.
   - 'Temperature': To display the real-time temperature data for the corresponding cities.

2. Allow users to input city names in the 'City' column.

3. Implement a button in the 'Check Temp' column that, when clicked, activates a script within Airtable.

4. Configure the script to call a weather API and fetch the current temperature for the listed cities.

5. Update the 'Temperature' column with the fetched temperature data for each city.

### Make Platform Integration

1. Replicate the process described above within the Make platform.

2. Design the scenario to retrieve all the city names from the Airtable.

3. Integrate with the weather API to fetch the temperature data for the cities.

4. Update the temperature data in the Airtable.

## Goal

This assignment aims to showcase your ability to proficiently manage and manipulate data, integrate with APIs, and work within different platforms to achieve the desired results. Good luck with your project!
